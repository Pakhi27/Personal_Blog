            <p style="text-align:center;margin-left:30px;margin-right:50px; color:#333;font-size:20px;font-weight:500">The JEE exam, short for the Joint Entrance
                Examination, is a competitive entrance exam in India for
                admission to various undergraduate engineering programs. It's divided into two main parts: JEE Main and
                JEE Advanced. </p>
            <p style="text-align:center;color:#333;font-size:20px;font-weight:500">"In my 11th grade, I began preparing for the JEE exam. My aim was to secure a
                seat in one of the
                prestigious national colleges and pursue my dream of obtaining a BTech degree in CSE from it, making my
                parents proud. To stay motivated, I often watched motivational videos that gave me strength and
                encouraged me to keep working hard."</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center;color:rgb(182, 105, 118)">Preparation Strategy</h2>
            <p style="text-align:center;margin-left:30px;margin-right:20px;color:#333;font-size:20px;font-weight:500">I attended school from 8 AM to 4 PM,
                followed by coaching classes at Aakash from 5:30 PM to 8:30 PM.
                Afterward, I dedicated my evenings to completing assignments from both school and coaching, which often
                included fortnightly coaching tests based on the JEE pattern and monthly test series organized by
                Aakash. Balancing preparation for both board exams and JEE was crucial, so I meticulously managed my
                time. This rigorous schedule allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of Physics, Chemistry, and
                Mathematics while simultaneously preparing for both JEE and board exams. Additionally, I made sure to
                allocate time for advanced preparation. Through diligent effort and effective time management, I
                successfully qualified the JEE with a percentile score of 95.5.</p>

                preparation while juggling school and
                coaching classes. I had to handle assignments, tests, and exams from both. But despite the challenges, I
                managed to do it all.</p>

            <p style="text-align:center;margin-left:30px;color:#333;font-size:20px;font-weight:500">I made sure to organize my time well, studying for both school
                and coaching exams. I created short notes
                and separate books for each subject. I revised the concepts regularly and divided my time equally among
                all three subjects. This helped me keep the concepts fresh in my mind and perform well in the exams.</p>

                preparation, I embarked on a journey fueled by determination
                and aspirations for a brighter future. Motivated by the prospect of securing admission to prestigious
                national colleges and realizing my dream of pursuing a BTech degree, I diligently balanced school,
                coaching classes, and self-study. Despite the challenges of managing rigorous schedules and balancing
                multiple commitments, I persevered with unwavering resolve. Through meticulous time management, regular
                revision, and dedication to continuous improvement, I not only conquered the complexities of JEE
                preparation but also excelled in both board exams and competitive tests. This journey taught me
                invaluable lessons in resilience, discipline, and the power of perseverance, culminating in the
                realization of my aspirations with a remarkable percentile score of 95.5 in the JEE exam.</p>
